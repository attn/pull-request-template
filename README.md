# ATTN: Pull Request Template

A modified pull request template based on http://quickleft.com/blog/pull-request-templates-make-code-review-easier.

## Usage

### Bookmarklet

When a pull request page is open, click the bookmark and the template will be copied into place.

The bookmarklet currently works in Chrome and Safari, but will not work in Firefox due to a bug in that browser. It might not work in other browsers, or stop working at any time due to browser upgrades. If so, [please open an issue](https://github.com/attn/pull-request-template/issues/new).

#### Installation

Select the Javascript in [bookmarklet.js](bookmarklet.js) and drag it into the bookmarks bar.

In Safari, after dragging the bookmark to the bookmarks bar, follow these steps:

- Copy the Javascript in [bookmarklet.js](bookmarklet.js).
- Right click the bookmark, and select "Edit Address...".
- Paste the Javascript and click "Done".
- Ask why oh why...

### Old Fashioned

Copy the template markdown from [pull-request-template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/attn/pull-request-template/master/pull-request-template.md) into the pull request body field.
